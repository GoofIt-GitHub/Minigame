# Minigame

A minigame plugin that is used for the inital backbone of any Minecraft minigame
The purpose of this plugin is for developers to add to and edit the already existing backend and frontend work for starting the creation
of any minigame.

## Build it yourself

The current logic consists of:

### Playable areans management

Prebuilt system for adding new arenas to the minigame and a way of accessing them through commands & the config.yml

### Commands

- /game list (Displays current arenas)
- /game leave (leave a current arena)
- /game join <id> (Join a current arena)
- /game start (Force start the game arena that you are currently in)
- /game stop (Force stop the game that you are currently in)

### Placeholder minigame

There is a current small and simple minigame added to show the functionality of the program.
The current minigame is simply the first person to break 20 blocks wins.
